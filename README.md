Web based digital book reader

License: GPL version 3.0

This is currently a skeleton only for a Web based Digital Book reader.
This reader will eventually be part of the helicon books book store (http://store.heliconbooks.com)

The reader will be based on templates which are HTML files with few divs with specific id's
The reader engine will read the template, display it and then use Ajax to fill in the div's.
If a div does not exist, it will be silently ignored.
